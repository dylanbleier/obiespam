# OBIESPAM
## because obietalk just isn't obietalk without spam.

This is a nice simple library for Obietalk spamming. Don't tell Will?

### Usage
Usage is fairly straightforward: use `get_posts` and `get_comments` to get text, then do stuff with that text, then use `spam` to share your creation with the world.

### Thanks
Luke, Liz, and Dan are winners!
